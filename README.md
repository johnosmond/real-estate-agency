## About Real Estate Agency

I worked on a project recently for a local real estate agency. One aspect of it that I thought would make a good demo is that the agents (new agents mostly) were required to fill out a checklist questionare to keep track of the requirements of coming on-board.

It is a good example of a many-to-many relationship.

## Connection with Microsoft Access

This web app will also be connected to from an Access database application using ODBC table links.

That way the agents can fill out the checklist online while the managers can manage the data in Access.

All of the data in this generic application is generated randomly. No actual data from the project will be used.
